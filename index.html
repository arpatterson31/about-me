                Hi, my name is Audrey! I'm from a small town in Michigan, but moved to Seattle after graduating high school. In 2018 I became a mother to a little girl. She is awesome, adorable, crazy, and sassy. I wouldn't change her one bit. I love all things cats, tattoos, and celebrities!

                My goal during this lab is to become more confident in my skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I would like to take this further into my Code Fellows journey as I move into Code 301 and Code 401. Ultimately, I'd love to be able to move into a career as a Software developer.
